# Classroom Lab
0.	Create a "Classroom" class. 
1.	It should store the room's ```name``` as a String as well as have a String of student names called ```students```.  
2.	There also should be a number (```num_students```) telling how many students are in the classroom as well as a constant ```MAX_STUDENTS``` setting the maximum number of students possible to 30.  
3.	The constructor should set the classroom name through a parameter.
4.	Write ```getName``` and ```setName``` methods for the classroom name.
5.	Add method ```getNumStudents``` to get the number of students in the classroom.   
6.	Write an ```addStudent``` method that takes a String parameter representing a new student and adds that student to the classroom separating each student by a space.
7.	Add a ```toString``` method that returns the students in the class.
8.	Write a class called ```Sample``` with method ```create()``` to return a class named “Aronson” with 3 students named "Sam", "Sara", and "Nate".
9.	Back in Classroom, write a method ```removeStudent``` that takes a String parameter and  removes that student from the classroom.  Return ```true``` if it successfully removed the student, ```false``` if it could not find the student.
